# Just Another Night

My entry for the gvarados game jam entry.

Here's some gameplay from a few of the judges.

All custom assets are made by myself. Models, textures, sounds, and of course the code. To anyone who plays I hope you enjoy it. I poured my soul into this game
for a solid 7 days.

## Gameplay

Gvarados plays it twice so I'll link both times.
